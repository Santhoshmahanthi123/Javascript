@book "The JavaScript Encyclopedia"

This is a work in progress. The goal of this project is to produce a complete

The encyclopedia will be developed in @link(Cyc), a simple language that was inspired 
by Brian Reid's Scribe. Cyc is described in the preface.The source of 
this book can be found at
